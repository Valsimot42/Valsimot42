<p align="left">Hi, my name is Tomislav, welcome to my Repository page!

I have started coding when I enrolled to 42 Wolfsburg in April 2022. I have economic background, having graduated economic highschool, and attended college for three years. In the same field I have work experience in accounting and marketing branches.

Further down you will see my current progress at 42, tackling projects in C/C++ and learning as much as I can before applying for a position of a software developer.</p>
