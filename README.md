<p align="left">My name is Tomislav, and I am the host of this beautiful programming den. I am currently a student in <b>42 Wolfsburg</b> and I am learning the basics of C language while screwing around with HTML and MD every once in a while(it's fun, don't judge me).
  
In any case, I hope that you find my code useful, be it in helping you understand what is going on, or just being thankful that you code better than me (the latter is probably going to be more common).</p>

<h2 align="center">My progress</h2>
